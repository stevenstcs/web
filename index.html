 <h2>Subjective and Objective Elements in Hi-Fi Audio</h2>
 <p>In the world of audio, whether it be headphones, monitors, or in-ear Monitors (IEMs), there is always a debate between the objective merits of a certain piece of equipment and the subjective elements of audio. Reviewers like <a href="https://crinacle.com/">Crinacle at In-Ear fidelity</a> try to strike a balance between the two ideas, though graphs and measurements can only take you so far. Measuring the technicalities of a pair of IEMs often relies of the listener's ability to listen critically, an ability which can be hampered by impairments like tinnitus or hearing loss. One can argue that all "sound is subjective", an argument that may have some merit to it, yet aspects like the soundstage of a pair of headphones are fairly universal and measurements of a device's frequency response often line up with the personal anecdotes found on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/">aptly named Headphones subreddit.</a>
 
 
 <h2>What makes 'good' audio? (WIP)</h2>
 <p>The definition of good audio varies from person to person, although there are elements that are widely agreed upon. 
 
 
 <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
 <p>While audio and the quality of audio may be subjective, there is undoubtedly an objective base for those opinions. These objective views can be used to explain the very subjective nature of the audiophile space, and allow us to somewhat midigate the inevitable bias that we bring into our impressions. 
 While it may be impossible to navigate around bias in reviews, you can aggregate a general consensus by reading impressions and reviews from sources like: <a href="https://www.head-fi.org/">the Head-Fi Forums</a>, <a href="https://crinacle.com/">the above-mentioned In-Ear Fidelity, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/">r/headphones</a>, and measurements from <a href="https://www.rtings.com/">RTINGS</a>.
