 <h2>Subjective and Objective Elements in Hi-Fi Audio</h2>
 <p>In the world of audio, whether it be headphones, Monitors, or In-Ear Monitors, there is always a debate between the objective merits of a certain piece of equipment and the subjective elements of audio. Reviewers like <a href="https://crinacle.com/">Crinacle at In-Ear fidelity</a> try to strike a balance between these two ideas, though graphs and measurements can only take you so far. Measuring the technicalities of a pair of IEMs often relies of the listener's ability to listen critically, an ability which can be hampered by impairments like tinnitus or hearing loss.
